# GeneticSnake
My attempt to get a Snake evolving through genetic algorithm

There are a few controls when you are in the Interface (you can find them in main.py):

# KEYCONTROL #

# Game Controls #
H : Hide or show the snake
F : Accelerate the snake (can also use the + key on the keypad)
S : Decelerate the snake (can also use the - key on the keypad)

# Genetic #
E : Toggle Evolution
B : Show the best of each gen
N : New game with the best of the current gen
